# Touchline

Touchline is a football management and competition platform built for fans who want control, not commentary. It enables users to create and manage teams, build dream lineups, and compete in structured auction-based leagues inside private lobbies.

Unlike preset fantasy systems, Touchline is strategy-first: every league is unique because squads are built through live auctions and drafts. Success depends on player valuation, squad construction, tactical balance, and league performance.

## 🎮 Vision

Touchline is designed as a neutral, reliable football competition platform — where teams are built, leagues are run, and outcomes are decided purely by strategy and choices made on the touchline.

No gimmicks. No preset squads. Only smart decisions.

* Live auction room UI with real-time bidding updates
* Custom league rule configuration
* Player stats integration
* Advanced squad evaluation metrics
* Season history and league archives
